<h1>Font Material Icons</h1>

> Version 3 â€“ the iconic SVG, font, and CSS framework

The internet's most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from
scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.

## Documentation

View the [Icon list](https://material.io/resources/icons) on how to use the material design icons in your project.

### Using a font collection

The `iconfont` folder contains pre-generated font files that can be included in a project. This is especially convenient for the web; however, it is generally better to link to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:

```html
<link href="./material-icons/material-icons.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

```Using the icons in HTML with mi prefix
<i class="mi mi-face"></i>
```
